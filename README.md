<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This repository outlines the essential post-installation configuration steps for setting up **osTicket** in a structured help desk environment. After completing the installation on your virtual machine via Remote Desktop, these steps prepare the system for real-world IT support operations.


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (22H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

Once osTicket is installed, it must be configured to:

- Define agent permissions

- Organize departments

- Control ticket visibility

- Establish service level agreements (SLAs)

- Create help topics for proper routing

- Add agents and users

This guide walks through each section inside the Admin and Agent panels.
<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

# Admin Panel vs Agent Panel

### Admin Panel

<p>
<img width="853" height="498" alt="Screenshot RD26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1afe101-bca2-47bb-9205-e9ac6626184b" />
</p>

Used for system configuration and management:

* Roles
* Departments
* Teams
* SLAs
* Help Topics
* User settings

This is where administrators control how the help desk functions.

### Agent Panel

<p>
<img width="853" height="498" alt="Screenshot RD27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd6931b4-dc4e-460d-8fa3-7b9c07140fd2" />
</p>

Used for operational tasks:

* Viewing and responding to tickets
* Managing users
* Daily support workflow

This is where support staff work tickets.

# Create Roles (Permission Groups)

<p>
<img width="853" height="498" alt="Screenshot RD28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f1968f0-02ef-48e7-b718-c4c56184fe61" />
</p>

 Admin Panel → Agents → Roles

Create:

 - "Supreme Admin"

Roles determine what agents are allowed to do within the system (edit tickets, manage users, configure settings, etc.).

---

# Create Departments (Ticket Routing & Visibility)

<p>
<img width="853" height="498" alt="Screenshot RD29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9946c687-633e-48e4-b454-1af7317c515d" />
</p>

 Admin Panel → Agents → Departments

Create:

 - "SysAdmins"

Departments help separate responsibilities such as:

 - Help Desk
 - System Administration
 - Networking

They control ticket assignment and visibility.

---

# Create Teams (Cross-Department Groups)

<p>
<img width="853" height="498" alt="Screenshot RD30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9cb80f8-f861-4d1a-90de-d230b27be9c0" />
</p>

 Admin Panel → Agents → Teams

Create:

 - "Online Banking"

Teams allow agents from different departments to collaborate on specific services or projects.

---

</p>

 Admin Panel → Settings → User Settings

To allow anyone to submit tickets:

 - Disable “Registration Required”

To require authentication before ticket creation:

 - Enable “Require registration and login”

For business environments, requiring registration is recommended.

# Conclusion

Completing the configuration of osTicket marks the transition from a basic installation to a fully structured help desk system. By setting up roles, departments, teams, SLAs, agents, users, and help topics, the platform is now organized to support real-world IT operations.

Through this process, we accomplished the following:

- Established clear permission structures with roles
- Organized ticket flow using departments and teams
- Implemented response expectations with SLAs
- Configured user access and ticket submission policies
- Created agents and users to simulate a live support environment
- Structured help topics for proper ticket routing

These configurations ensure that tickets are properly categorized, assigned, and resolved efficiently. More importantly, this setup reflects how enterprise IT support environments operate in production.

With everything in place, the system is now ready for:

- Ticket intake
- Issue tracking
- Priority management
- Team collaboration
- Scalable support workflows

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with system administration, access control, workflow design, and service management — all essential skills for IT Support and Help Desk roles.

The help desk is officially operational.
